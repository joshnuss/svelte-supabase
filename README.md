Adds Supabase to Svelte
----------------------

## ❓ What is this?
This is an **experimental** command to run to add Supabase to your SvelteKit project.

## 🛠 Usage
You must start with a fresh copy of the official SvelteKit template, which is currently created by running this command:

```sh
npm init svelte@next
```

Once that is set up, run this command in your project directory to set up Supabase:

```sh
npx apply supabase-community/svelte-supabase
```

After the preset runs,
* Install dependencies with `npm install`, `yarn install` or `pnpm install`
* Add supabase key to your `.env`. You can find them by [logging into supabase](https://app.supabase.io/) and going to the Settings / API page.
